TO SPECIFY
  For Model-Check Mode: 
     The Specification:
        - A Temporal Formula, or
        - Initial Predicate
          Next-state Action
          [Fairness]:  
            - A Temporal Formula, or
            - A set of <<Action, SF/WF choice>> pairs
   
     The Model:
        [Model Values]
          Should be both declared in TLA+ spec and
          given to TLC as model values.
        CONSTANT values
        [Substitutions]
          Default includes a substitution for any constant
          foo with definition of the form:
             foo == CHOOSE x : x \notin expr, or
             foo == CHOOSE x : ~ (x \in expr)
        [Constraint] 
        [Symmetry]
   
     What To Check:
       [Invariant]
       [Property]
       [Possibly: A spec (Module/Formula) + refinement mapping]
       Deadlock/NoDeadlock

    How to Execute
      number of worker threads
     
    What to Show:
      [coverage]
      [warnings]
      progress: (numbers and/or graph)
        states generated
        distinct states generated
        unexamined states (queue)
      when checkpointing being done
        and perhaps how long since last done

  For Debug mode:
     Same as for Model-Check, plus:
       BreakPoint actions:
          Stop
          ConditionalPrint
          LocateError:
             Add start / stop markers, and on error
               tell user if error occurred between
               markers.
         Evaluate an action A on a step s1 -> s2.
            Done by making the next state action:
                 s2' /\ A
            This is done to evaluate the debug actions
                embedded in A.
         Rerun a trace, printing out the values of state functions
           in each state--and perhaps transition functions.
     Debug definitions:
        In middle of spec (before next-state action def)
        Outside spec (in module the EXTENDS spec)

     except:
        A possible alternative Initial Predicate
        No coverage?

  For Simulation Mode:
    Same as for Model-Check, plus
       depth
       seed
       aril
    except:
      No coverage?
      Single thread?
      No progress?

  For Restart:
     Same as for Model-Check, plus:
        the checkpoint

  For Expression-Evaluation
    The Model (as for Model-Check)
    A set of expressions to evaluate.
      (Should be saved between executions)
    Initial state (only if not all expressions are constant)
    Second state  (only if some expression is action-level)
    Add a pretty-printing feature, as discussed with Tom.
