TO START SVC-LAMPORT-7 AS A TESTBED
  https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/computer/svc/
  log in as lamport/lamportpassword
  Start the slave.
  
  Note: To set up a new machine to replace SVC-LAMPORT-7,
        must install Java jdk and add the environment variable JAVA_HOME 
        and set it to something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26


TO PREPARE THE ZIP FILES FOR THE TOOLBOX RELEASE

Notes: 1. To get tlatools.jar file copied to the right place for the distributed version of TLC, 
          after running Ant, run "mvn install" in the directory
      
            C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.jnlp
            
       2. If maven doesn't produce a good build, try running `mvn clean' before
          running `mvn install'
          
       3. The file .../newtools/tla2-inria/pom.xml is not automatically updated
          by SVN inside Eclipse, and must be updated by running 'svn up pom.xml'
          in a Cygwin shell.  Running `svn up' in a Cygwin shell might not be a bad
          idea, because it seems to update some things that Eclipse doesn't.

Step 1: Get the right version numbers to appear:


In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone 
  plugin.xml : line 32 (the "aboutText" property), update date and version 
               and other stuff that appears in the Help/About window.  

  standalone.product: 
    As of 24 Jun 2011, standalone.product has moved to:
    org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
     Branding tab: update date and version (This may be used in Help > About.)
     Overview: update version.  (I don't know if this is used anywhere.)


In org.lamport.tla.toolbox/welcome/welcomeView.html
   Update date and version

OBSOLETE:
In toolbox.product.standalone/intro/root.xhtml: 
  update version information.

Step 2: Build the .zip files:
Method 1: 
Note: org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
       before June 2011 was named
   org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone.product
   
   
  synchronize and use Eclipse Product export wizard
  In the first menu, give
    Product Configuration: 
      Configuration:
        /org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
      Root directory: toolbox
    Synchronization:
      Synchronize before exporting
    Destination:
      Archive file:
        c:\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k  or
        c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k on svc-lamport-4
        
    Export Options
      Generate metadata repository
      Export for muliple platforms
      Allow for binary cycles in target platform
  In Cross-platform export menu, select
    linux (gtk/x86 & x86_64)
    macosx (cocoa/x86 & x86_64
    win32 (win32/x86 & x86_64)

 Hitting Finish then puts the zip files into:
     c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release
 The repository/ directory in c:\users\lamport\tla\ contains the content for the update site (p2)

Method 2. Using Maven
  Set the version number in ...product.product/pom.xml.
  (The target platforms to build for are specified in tla2-inria/pom.xml.  This file also specifies
   what version of the Eclipse libraries to build with.)
  In a Cygwin shell, 
   - cd to ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria
   - run:  mvn install
  This runs tests, which could fail.
  To not run the tests, instead run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  To have it do the tests but continue if it fails, run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
  The .zip files are in
       C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatools\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product\version-number-SNAPSHOT
  This will keep accumulating new versions.  To delete an old version, delete the
       C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatoolbox\
    directory.

Method 3. Using tla.msr-inria.inria.fr
  - In browser, goto https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
  - login
  - to make a new release: click on the button to the right of
       Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone  
  - to get the release zip files, 
       * go to 
          https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/job/M-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone/os=master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/target/
       * click on products
       * copy 6 zip files
   Alternate way to get to the https://...target/ page:
    - click on M-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone
    - click on Master
    - click on Last Successful Build
    - click on .../target

TO PREPARE THE STAND-ALONE TLA TOOLS RELEASE ZIP FILE
  Run the Ant default-release option.  This will put the release in
     C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria\tlatools\dist\tla.zip

TO GENERATE THE RELEASE:
  Go to  Code Posting Tool - My Requests
    http://msrredtools/tools/publish/cpt_v26/research/list.aspx
  Click on the version:
  Click on Upgrade Installation
     Indicate new version number
  Note: when uploading the file, wait for progress bar at bottom
    of screen to indicate it's done (and for new file name to
    appear in Installation field)
    
TO DEPLOY THE UPDATE SITE (p2) TO http://lamport.org/tlatoolbox/ (redirected to http://msr-inria.inria.fr/~doligez/tlatoolbox):
  Clean the current update site from nation.msr-inria.inria.fr:/home/tla/doligez/public_html/toolboxUpdate/
    (Authenticate with msr-inria credentials. "tla" group members have write permissions)
  Copy the zip file org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product-version-number-SNAPSHOT.zip in 
  C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatools\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product\version-number-SNAPSHOT to nation.msr-inria.inria.fr:/home/tla/doligez/public_html/toolboxUpdate/
  Unzip the zip to toolboxUpdate/ on nation
  toolboxUpdate/ will look like (no index.html file or alike!):
  	binary/
  	features/
  	plugins/
  	artifacts.jar
  	content.jar
