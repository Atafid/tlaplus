TO START SVC-LAMPORT-7 AS A TESTBED
  https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/computer/svc/
  log in as lamport/lamportpassword
  Start the slave.
  
  Note: To set up a new machine to replace SVC-LAMPORT-7,
        must install Java jdk and add the environment variable JAVA_HOME 
        and set it to something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26


TO PREPARE THE ZIP FILES FOR THE TOOLBOX RELEASE

Notes: 1. To get tlatools.jar file copied to the right place for the distributed version of TLC, 
          after running Ant, run "mvn install" in the directory
      
            C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.jnlp
            
       2. If maven doesn't produce a good build, try running `mvn clean' before
          running `mvn install'
          
       3. The file .../newtools/tla2-inria/pom.xml is not automatically updated
          by SVN inside Eclipse, and must be updated by running 'svn up pom.xml'
          in a Cygwin shell.  Running `svn up' in a Cygwin shell might not be a bad
          idea, because it seems to update some things that Eclipse doesn't.

Step 1: Get the right version numbers to appear:


In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone 
  plugin.xml : line 32 (the "aboutText" property), update date and version 
               and other stuff that appears in the Help/About window.  

  standalone.product: 
    As of 24 Jun 2011, standalone.product has moved to:
    org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
     Branding tab: update date and version (This is be used in Help > About and used to
        create zip file names.)
     Overview: update version.  (I don't know if this is used anywhere.)


In org.lamport.tla.toolbox/welcome/welcomeView.html
   Update date and version

OBSOLETE:
In toolbox.product.standalone/intro/root.xhtml: 
  update version information.

Step 2: Build the .zip files:
Method 1: 
Note: org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
       before June 2011 was named
   org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone.product
   
   
  synchronize and use Eclipse Product export wizard
  In the first menu, give
    Product Configuration: 
      Configuration:
        /org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
      Root directory: toolbox
    Synchronization:
      Synchronize before exporting
    Destination:
      Archive file:
        c:\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k  or
        c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k on svc-lamport-4
        
    Export Options
      Generate metadata repository
      Export for muliple platforms
      Allow for binary cycles in target platform
  In Cross-platform export menu, select
    linux (gtk/x86 & x86_64)
    macosx (cocoa/x86 & x86_64
    win32 (win32/x86 & x86_64)

 Hitting Finish then puts the zip files into:
     c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release
 The repository/ directory in c:\users\lamport\tla\ contains the content for the update site (p2)

Method 2. Using Maven
  Run svn update on  pom.xml in ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria. 
  Set the version number in ...product.product/pom.xml.
  (The target platforms to build for are specified in tla2-inria/pom.xml.  This file also specifies
   what version of the Eclipse libraries to build with.)
  In a Cygwin shell, 
   - cd to ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria
   - run:  mvn install
  This runs tests, which could fail.
  To not run the tests, instead run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  To have it do the tests but continue if it fails, run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
  The .zip files are in
       C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatoolbox\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product\version-number-SNAPSHOT
  This will keep accumulating new versions.  To delete an old version, delete the
       C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatoolbox\
    directory.

Method 3. Using tla.msr-inria.inria.fr
  - In browser, goto https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
  - login
  - to make a new release: click on the button to the right of
       Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone  
       This isn't released publicly until I do the release step, below
  - to get the release zip files, 
       * go to 
          https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlatoolbox/staged
              /products = toolbox zip files
              /dist = tools distribution
          an alternative is:
               https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/job/M-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone/os=master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/target/
               * click on products
       * copy 6 zip files from /products and tla.zip from /dist
     Another alternate way to get to the https://...target/ page:
      On https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
       1. click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone 
       2. click on Latest product zips
      to get to the stand-alone TLA tools release zip file, in step 2
      click on "TLA+ distribution zip".  The release is in tla.zip.
  - To release this:
     Click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone (direct link https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/job/Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone/)
     Click on most recent build in build history.
     Click on Promotion Status.
     Click on Approve.
     

    

TO PREPARE THE STAND-ALONE TLA TOOLS RELEASE ZIP FILE (IN 
Methods 1 and 2)
  Run the Ant default-release option.  This will put the release in
     C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria\tlatools\dist\tla.zip

TO GENERATE THE RELEASE:
  Go to  Code Posting Tool - My Requests
    http://msrredtools/tools/publish/cpt_v26/research/list.aspx
  Click on the version:
  Click on Upgrade Installation
     Indicate new version number
  Note: when uploading the file, wait for progress bar at bottom
    of screen to indicate it's done (and for new file name to
    appear in Installation field)
