TLA+ Error Reports That Can Be Mapped to PCal Code
---------------------------------------------------
- Parser Errors

- TLC errors. Expression evaluation in:
   * Initial predicate   
       This seems to just report a single location,
       exactly where the error occurs.
   * process set. (no location reported)
   * expression in statement: can be
      + the expression
      + conjunct of action containing the expression
      + a previous conjunct of that action
      + the last character (and perhaps more) of 
        the first conjunct of that action.
        This seems to be a minor TLC bug

- Error-Trace action location.
  (Double-click needed to go to TLA+ location.)

- Coverage.  Can go to
   * conjunction of action definition
   * variable in UNCHANGED expression
   * variable in vars location

Note: assertion failure error already maps to PCal code location.
(But not if file has been edited since last translator run.)

NOTES
-----
- If the translator is modified to use a single TLA+ variable for
two different local PCal variables of the same name, then a variable
name in the TLA+ spec does not map to a unique piece of PCal code
in the <Variables Declaration> and <Init Definition>.  And additional
information will need to be kept to map variable names to the correct
PCal declaration for cases where there is a unique mapping.

- For a multi-assignment such as 

   x[i] := ... || x[j] := ...
   
the <Variable> of and <Assignment> does not correspond to a unique
occurrence of the variable in the PCal code.

- Among the stuff added in the translation are parentheses around expressions.
