1. NEW FEATURE
   Add way to tell if spec on which a model was last run is the same as the current
   spec.
   
2. BUG - SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED (7 Oct 2009)
   For some reason, the toolbox didn't seem to notice when the Additional Definitions 
   fields was changed.  Even though the editor's tab had a star next to it, trying to
   save the model did nothing, and hitting the launch button produced an MC.tla file 
   with an obsolete version of the field.  I had to type something into the field
   to make the toolbox notice the change and allow me to save the model.
   
3. BUG (Running TLC in Simulation mode)
   The toolbox doesn't parse the TLC output correctly in simulation mode.  In particular,
   it didn't notice that an invariant had been violated and didn't raise the error
   window.
   
4. BUG (Progress Information)
   The progress information is not being displayed.
   
5. NEW FEATURE (Locking Models)
   If the user adds or removes a declared CONSTANT from the spec while a model is
   being run by TLC, that changes the model.  For example, if the spec is run with
   a constant N instantiated with 42 and N is removed from the spec, then the N <- 42
   disappears from the model and the user has no way of telling what N was instantiated
   with during the current run.
   
   This particular problem was solved on 1 Oct 2009 by Simon with LL looking on.  
   However, we still have the problem that TLC might be running for weeks, and the
   user in the meantime changed the spec.  When TLC stops running, the model gets
   revalidated and stuff that was in the model configuration gets lost.
   Here is a possible solution:  Add the notion of a model being LOCKED, meaning that
   it cannot be changed in any way, meaning that it is read only and it doesn't 
   change to conform to the current spec.  (This state actually exists in the
   toolbox now: it is called "model in use".)  In particular, it conforms to the copy of
   the spec that's salted away with the model.  Running the spec locks the model.
   There will also be a menu item that the use can select to lock the spec himself.
   (This will allow the user to protect himself from accidentally modifying or re-running
   a spec by mistake--perhaps losing a trace that took weeks for TLC to produce.)
   We must decide what should happen to the lock state when a TLC run completes.
   Should the user have to explicitly unlock it?  I suggest that it be unlocked when
   the run completes if and only if that run did not take too long--where "too long" is
   a user-settable preference. 
   
6. MISSING FEATURE -- SEEMS NOW TO BE IMPLEMENTED (7 Oct 2009)
   Checkpoint restoration is not implemented.

7. TLC BUG (Coverage)
   Coverage is not working, coverage information being displayed only after a run 
   completes.  The bug is in TLC, which isn't printing the coverage information. 
   
8. IMPORTANT MISSING FEATURE  (Definition Override)
   A definition override of an operator with no arguments should include the
   option of making it a model value.  (This is not a show-stopper because the
   user can replace it by a model value that he declares in the model-value
   section.)
   
9. MINOR MISSING FEATURES (TLC Model)
   a. There is no reason why the user cannot use the same model value in two
   different constant instantiations or in a constant instantiation and a 
   definition override.  Or uses a model value declared on the advanced
   page as a model value in a constant instantiation.  This requires
   checking that a model value is declared elsewhere before adding a
   CONSTANT declaration for it.  
   
   b. The correct order in which things should be written in the MC file are:
       - Declaration of advanced model values.
       - Declaration of the sets of model values that instantiate constants.
       - New User Definitions.
       - Everything Else, which is all of the form 
         newId_1234567 == some expression.
   However, the current structure of the toolbox makes it a nuisance to do
   this, and the current validator will disallow the models that this order
   is designed to allow.  
   
10. BUG (TLC Error View)
    If I get a TLC error and close the TLC Error view, reopening it with
    the TLC Model Checker/ TLC Errors menu option produces a blank error
    window.  I have to click on the Errors Detected field to get
    the right TLC Errors view.
    
11. MINOR BUG (Parsing Error View)
    The Parsing Error item on the Window menu should be disabled when there is no 
    parsing error.
    
12. MINOR BUG (Parsing Error View)
    When the spec is reparsed after a parsing error, the Parsing Error view
    is displayed, and no errors are found, the Parsing Error view continues to
    contain the previous error.  The view has to be closed to make that error disappear.
    
13. BUG (PlusCal Translator Errors)
    Suppose the user starts to write a PlusCal algorithm,
    translates it and gets a PlusCal error, and then decides to delete the PlusCal
    code and just write the spec in TLA+.  There's no way for him to get rid of
    the PlusCal error message in the Parse Errors window.  In fact, even if I
    run the translator on another module, the PlusCal
    error remains in the Parse Error window--whether or not the other
    translation produces an error. (The only way to get rid of it is to go
    back to the original module, correct the PlusCall error, and re-run the
    translator.)  The best thing to do 
    is probably to create a separate PlusCal Error Window.  Running the
    translator should first clear this window and remove all PlusCal
    error markers in the module on which the translator is run.  (I believe that
    if running the PlusCal translator creates a PlusCal error, then the file is
    not re-parsed, so only the PlusCal error window would need to be popped up.)
    
14. SHOW-STOPPER SANY BUG - FIXED 7 October 2009
    SANY2 does not correctly parse an expression containing a "<" immediately followed
    by a number.  This is undoubtedly a lexing error, the lexer thinking that
    it is finding the beginning of a proof-step number.
       
15. POSSIBLE CHANGE (Handling Unparsed Spec)
    We need to re-think what the user 
    should be able to do to the model when the spec is unparsed; and see that anything he
    shouldn't be able to do is disabled and that anything he should be able to do works.
    
16. NOT A PROBLEM
    My Stupidity

17. MINOR BUG (Definition Override)
    The Definitions Override menu allows the user to override the same definition multiple
    times.
    
18. SIGNIFICANT BUG (parsing large specs)
    For a big spec--in particular, for the farsite spec, after Parse the parse spec
    command gets disabled.  But parse module file still works.  Simon thinks it may be
    that the build infrastructure of Eclipse is deactivating builders under some
    conditions--for example, if a builder dies with an exception, it is deactivated.
    Perhaps it's also deactivated on a time-out.  The list of builders is attached to the
    project, so one can query the project or the project nature to find this out.  So,
    Simon assumes that for some reason, the builder is deactivated.

    The parser is being launched in a separate thread, but Simon thinks
    that perhaps he's not doing it in the right way.
    
19. MINOR MISSING FEATURE (Exit)
    Closing the toolbox simply kills any running TLC.  Instead, 
    it should warn the user that this will kill TLC and give him
    the option of canceling.  To do this, need to modify to 
    CloseSpecHandler.execute() so it checks if editors have been closed
    successfully before exiting.  The model editor's method that
    gets called by the closeAllEditors method should return false.
    Another approach is to register another handler in place of
    this one when TLC is running, and having that handler call the 
    current one only if the user says it's OK to stop TLC.
    
20. MISSING FEATURE (PlusCal)
    PlusCal translation needs to be examined.  Here are some things
    that need to be fixed: 
     - There should be a more user-friendly way to specify translation
       options.  This involves:
       (a) Providing check-boxes or radio buttons for the common options.
       (b) Finding a more convenient way to add them than the current
           one (right-clicking in the Toolbox Explorer) and selecting
           properties.
     - Translation options are now attached to the spec; they should
       be attached to an individual module.  (It's possible for a
       single spec to have PlusCal algorithms in two different 
       modules.)
       
    
21. TUNING NEEDED BEFORE RELEASE (Preferences)
    Need to filter Preferences to eliminate things the user doesn't want
    to see.
    
22. BUG  (rename spec)
    The rename spec command doesn't do the right thing if a spec by
    that name already exists.
    
23. SAME AS 9
        
24. BUG FIXED ON 1 OCT 2009 by Simon
    Definition override validator is not allowing the re-use of definition parameters.  
    For example, if you override
    
        foo(a) <- <<a>>
        bar(a) <- {a}
     
    the validator complains about the use of the parameter a in the definition of 
    bar.  It shouldn't.
     
        
25. SIGNIFICANT BUG -- FIXED 8 October 2009
    The toolbox would get into a mode such that you have to open a spec twice to get 
    something other than a blank editor window.  As of 7 Oct 2009, this hadn't 
    happened in a couple of weeks, so some other change may have fixed it.
    
26. MINOR BUG -- APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED (8 October 2009)
    Each time the user closes and reopens the toolbox when there are errors from TLC, 
    the number of errors increases each time by the number of actual TLC errors on 
    the model.

27. MINOR BUG  (Parse Spec/Module Commands)
    If I select Parse spec from the file menu when the file is dirty,
    a popup asks me if I want to save the resource.  If I say yes, it 
    doesn't save the file and parses the spec that's on disk.  If I 
    select Parse Module from the file menu when the module is dirty,
    it doesn't ask me if I want to save it.  I expect it should.
     
28. MINOR BUG  (Reset Window Layout)
    If I select window / reset window layout in the Welcome Perspective,
    it produces a blank window instead of the Welcome View.
    
29. FEATURE (Module Editor Keybindings)
    Here are some thoughts on enhancements to the Module Editor.
    - Add a preference to choose an Emacs-like keybinding.  This requires
      adding new commands that appear in the General/Editors/Keys, and
      options that choose from among sets of bindings.
    - Add editing commands (and invent bindings) for comments.  Perhaps
      copy the commands I use for boxing comments.
    Note that Simon has bound toggle comments to Control-/, but that command
    doesn't appear either when I type Ctl-Shift-L or in tthe preferences
    keybinding options.
    
30. MINOR BUG (TLC Error View)
    When I close a spec that has the TLC Error window raised and then
    open a new spec, the TLC Error window is raised again.  If that window
    shows an error, then it shows the same error when the new spec is
    opened.
    
31. BUG (Definition Override)
    If a model contains a definition override and the defined symbol is
    removed from the spec, the override is not removed.  Moreover, in that
    case trying to run TLC on the model does nothing--it just logs "Skipping
    resource" messages for the MC file and the spec's root file.  I expect
    that we just have to add to the validate method a check that every defined 
    symbol is still defined with the same number of arguments.  If it's no
    longer defined, we should just remove the override.  If the number of
    arguments has changed, we should report an error.
  
32. MINOR BUG (What to parse when)
    The toolbox doesn't seem to be doing the right thing when deciding what
    to parse when the user requests that a module be parsed.  This needs to
    be re-examined and specified precisely, and then we need to make sure that
    the implementation does what it's supposed to.

33. FEATURE (TLC error reporting)
    When TLC returns an error stack trace, make clicking on the locations
    highlight and go to those locations in the module.
    
34. FEATURE (Stack trace)
    Make clicking on the action location highlight and go to that location.
