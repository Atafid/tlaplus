1. Add way to tell if spec on which a model was last run is the same as the current
   spec.
   
2. For some reason, the toolbox didn't seem to notice when the Additional Definitions 
   fields was changed.  Even though the editor's tab had a star next to it, trying to
   save the model did nothing, and hitting the launch button produced an MC.tla file 
   with an obsolete version of the field.  I had to type something into the field
   to make the toolbox notice the change and allow me to save the model.
   
3. The toolbox doesn't parse the TLC output correctly in simulation mode.  In particular,
   it didn't notice that an invariant had been violated and didn't raise the error
   window.
