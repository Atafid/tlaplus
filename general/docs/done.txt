2. BUG - SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED (7 Oct 2009)
   For some reason, the toolbox didn't seem to notice when the Additional Definitions 
   fields was changed.  Even though the editor's tab had a star next to it, trying to
   save the model did nothing, and hitting the launch button produced an MC.tla file 
   with an obsolete version of the field.  I had to type something into the field
   to make the toolbox notice the change and allow me to save the model.
   
4. BUG (Progress Information) - FIXED by Dan (9 October 2009)
   The progress information is not being displayed.
   
6. MISSING FEATURE -- SEEMS NOW TO BE IMPLEMENTED (7 Oct 2009)
   Checkpoint restoration is not implemented.

7. TLC BUG (Coverage) -- FIXED (9 Oct 2009)
   Coverage is not working, coverage information being displayed only after a run 
   completes.  The bug is in TLC, which isn't printing the coverage information. 
   
10. BUG (TLC Error View) -- FIXED BY DAN Oct 2009
    If I get a TLC error and close the TLC Error view, reopening it with
    the TLC Model Checker/ TLC Errors menu option produces a blank error
    window.  I have to click on the Errors Detected field to get
    the right TLC Errors view.
    
11. MINOR BUG (Parsing Error View) - MOSTLY FIXED BY DAN 10 Oct 2009
    The Parsing Error item on the Window menu should be disabled when there is no 
    parsing error.
    
14. SHOW-STOPPER SANY BUG - FIXED 7 October 2009
    SANY2 does not correctly parse an expression containing a "<" immediately followed
    by a number.  This is undoubtedly a lexing error, the lexer thinking that
    it is finding the beginning of a proof-step number.
       
23. SAME AS 9
        
24. BUG FIXED ON 1 OCT 2009 by Simon
    Definition override validator is not allowing the re-use of definition parameters.  
    For example, if you override
    
        foo(a) <- <<a>>
        bar(a) <- {a}
     
    the validator complains about the use of the parameter a in the definition of 
    bar.  It shouldn't.
     
37. MINOR BUG (TLC Error report) - DONE DR 10/12/09
    Here's how to produce the bug:
    Create a new spec that just declares a single variable x.  Create a
    model with the spec defined by letting Init be x=0 and Next be x’=x.  Add
    the invariant x=1 and run the model.  Look at the model overview page.  It
    looks fine.  Now change the invariant to x = "a" and run it again.  This
    time, the model overview page puts the TLC error report at the top of
    the page, where it should say something like "1 error".
    
38. BUG (Validation of model) -- FIXED BY LL on 11 October 2009
    The code to validate the use of symmetry in MainModelPage.validatePage
    was bogus.  I therefore commented out the test.  (See line 330, or look for
    the dead code in the if(false).)  Here's what should actually be checked.
    Define the symmetry model values to be the set of all model values that
    appear in sets of model values that are declared to be symmetric in the
    constant instantiatiions.  TLC will produce an error if there are two
    symmetry model values having different types--that is, both typed and having
    different types.  This will occur if the user instantiates a constant
    with a set of model values including A_c and B_d that is declared to
    be symmetric, or if he declares two different sets of model values to be
    symmetric, and one include A_c and the other include B_d.  This is what
    the validatePage method should check for.
