  ModelEditor 
    Sets up the Model Editor, including its pages.  The individual
    pages are set up by the  
      MainModelPage, AdvancedModelPage, and ResultPage;

   loadData() initializes the editor.  
   validate() is called through some plug-in magic whenever 
     the spec is parsed (but probably only if the parse is correct)
     and probably when the user has made some change in the model editor.
     It is also run when the model editor is initialized.

Various pieces of code are notified when the spec is opened, parsed,
and closed by listeners registered to the extension point
org.lamport.tla.toolbox.spec of the plugin org.lamport.tla.toolbox.
This extension point interacts via a class that extends the class
SpecLifecycleParticipant.  So, finding all classes that extend this
should permit one to find every place that gets notified when the spec
is opened, closed, or parsed.  However, this is all done by so many 
levels of indirection that we have not succeeded in doing this.
For example, ModelEditor.validate() is called when the module is parsed,
and this must be through that extension point.  But we have not discovered
the path from the extension point to that method.

The spec status indicator in the lower-right corner is apparently
set by  ParseStatusContributionItem . update().

How to create a distribution.

Go to org....product.standalone
   This contains no functionality, but "builds application stuff".
   
The following stuff needs to be done just once for each computer.
   
Open standalone.product / Overview tab
  Need to specify target platform.
  By default, Eclipse uses itself as the target
     platform.
  Need to define a separate copy of the distribution
    as the target platform.
  
 
 1. Unzip Eclipse platform from eclipse-rcp-galileo-win32.zip into somewhere as the
     the target platform.  I've put it in tla/target-platform
 
 2. Go to Eclipse download page, download 
     Eclipse delta pack.  Usually in
     "Other Downloads".  (search for "delta")
     Extract it to a new directory.  I've put it in tla/delta-pack, merging
     with the stuff extracted above. 
     
 3. Go to Window/ preferences/Plug-in Development/Target Platform
    
   Hit Add.
   Choose "nothing" & hit next
   In Target Contact
     Enter name, like "Galileo 3.5"
     Location hit add:
        select Installation & hit next
        Select target-platform directory .../tla/target-platform/eclipse 
          and hit finish [included 487 of 487]
     Hit add again
       select Directory and hit next
       select .../delta-pack/eclipse directory and hit
          finish [61 of 61]
     Hit finish.
  Check "Galileo 3.5" in Target Platform to make it active.
  Hit OK, and watch it rebuild.
       
The following stuff needs to be done for each release.

  1. Open standalone product / overview page
  2. Hit on Eclipse Product Export Wizard

INTRO
Intro page in : org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone / intro/root.xhtml.
   Source page for each topic is in org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone /intro/*.xhtml
   Each such topic page has an href link whose id field must be registered (linking
       it to the page) by adding the appropriate stuff to 
       org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone /intro/introContent.xml
