  ModelEditor 
    Sets up the Model Editor, including its pages.  The individual
    pages are set up by the  
      MainModelPage, AdvancedModelPage, and ResultPage;

   loadData() initializes the editor.  
   validate() is called through some plug-in magic whenever 
     the spec is parsed (but probably only if the parse is correct)
     and probably when the user has made some change in the model editor.
     It is also run when the model editor is initialized.

Various pieces of code are notified when the spec is opened, parsed,
and closed by listeners registered to the extension point
org.lamport.tla.toolbox.spec of the plugin org.lamport.tla.toolbox.
This extension point interacts via a class that extends the class
SpecLifecycleParticipant.  So, finding all classes that extend this
should permit one to find every place that gets notified when the spec
is opened, closed, or parsed.  However, this is all done by so many 
levels of indirection that we have not succeeded in doing this.
For example, ModelEditor.validate() is called when the module is parsed,
and this must be through that extension point.  But we have not discovered
the path from the extension point to that method.

The spec status indicator in the lower-right corner is apparently
set by  ParseStatusContributionItem . update().
