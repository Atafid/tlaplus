<h1>Manipulating Specs</h1>
<p>

A specification has a <em>name</em> and a <em>root module</em>, which
is in a file whose extension is <code>.tla</code>.&nbsp;

You will probably give your spec the same name as its root module, but
you need not.&nbsp;

You can create two different specifications with the same root module,
but there's little reason to do that.&nbsp;

Two different specs cannot have the same name.  Here are the Toolbox's
spec operations.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning:</b> if you want to use the <a href="../model/model.html">model checker</a>,
your spec must not contain a module named  <code>MC</code> .
</p>
<h3>Create</h3>

You can create a new spec with the  <samp>File/Open Spec/Add New
Spec... </samp> menu item.&nbsp;

It raises a dialog asking you to choose the root file (which must have
the extension <code>.tla</code>) and the specification name.  


<h3>Open</h3>

You can open an existing spec by choosing it from the  <samp>File/Open
Spec</samp> menu.&nbsp; 

You can also use the <em>Spec Explorer</em>, which is opened either
from the <samp>File</samp> menu or by clicking on the <IMG
SRC="spec-explorer-icon.gif" Align="bottom"/> icon on the left side of
the Toolbox, near the top.&nbsp;

Right-click on the desired spec and select
<samp>Open</samp>.&nbsp;  

If you open a spec when another spec is open, the other spec will
automatically be closed.


<h3>Close</h3>

You can close a spec with the  <samp>File/Close Spec</samp>  menu.&nbsp;

This returns you to the Welcome View.&nbsp;   

However, remember that the Toolbox will close the current spec if you
open another one.

<h3>Rename, Forget, and Delete</h3>

Forgetting a spec means that the Toolbox removes it from the 
Spec Explorer and the list of specs presented by the
<samp>File/Open Spec</samp> menu.&nbsp; 

If you later re-open a spec with the same name in the same folder, then 
you will be able to import to previous spec's models.&nbsp;

Deleting a spec means forgetting it and deleting its models, but not
any of its modules.&nbsp;

Renaming a spec changes the spec's name, but not the name of its root 
module.&nbsp;  


You can rename, forget, or delete or rename an existing spec by opening the Spec Explorer
(described above), right-clicking on the desired spec, and making the
appropriate choice.&nbsp;

<p>

Note: here's how to change the name of both a spec and its root module from
<code>Foo</code> to <code>Bar</code>: Rename spec 
<code>Foo</code> to <code>Bar</code>, save module <code>Foo</code>
as module <code>Bar</code> (using the <samp>File/Save As</samp> 
command), Forget module <code>Bar</code>, and Open a new spec named
<code>Bar</code> with module <code>Bar</code> as its root module.&nbsp;

<h3>Finding Your Spec</h3>

It's easy to forget where in your file system a spec's module files are.   
To find them, open the
Spec Explorer view, right-click
on the spec's name, and select <samp>Properties</samp> .&nbsp;   

This will bring up a dialog that shows you the root-module file's
complete path name.&nbsp;  

(The rest of the spec's module files are in the same folder.)


<h3>Moving a Spec from Elsewhere</h3>

<P> 

Here is how to move an existing spec named  <samp>SName </samp> to a
different folder (directory) on the same computer, or to a different
computer.&nbsp; 

Copy all the spec's module files (the root-module file and its
imported module files) and the folder (directory) named 
<samp>SName.toolbox </samp> to the new location.&nbsp;  

If there is already a spec named  <samp>SName </samp> (which will be
the case if you're moving the spec to a different place on the same
computer), have the Toolbox forget or delete it.&nbsp;  

Open a new specification named   <samp>SName </samp> using the new
copy of the root-module file.
 </P>

<h3>Keeping Copies of a Spec on Different Computers</h3> 

 <p> 
You may want to run the Toolbox on different machines for the same
spec.&nbsp;

Once you've created a spec on one machine, copy the spec's module
files and <samp>.toolbox </samp> directory to the other machine
and use the instructions above to create a copy of the spec on that
machine.&nbsp;

When you modify the spec or its models on one machine, just copy the
module files and <samp>.toolbox </samp> directory to the other
machine.&nbsp;

Strange things might happen if you do that while the spec is open in
the Toolbox on that other machine.&nbsp;

It's a good idea to close the spec on that machine before copying the
files.&nbsp;

If you forget to do that, you will probably need to close and re-open
the spec to see the new version in the Toolbox.&nbsp;

If strange things happen when you do that, try closing and re-opening
the Toolbox.&nbsp;

If that doesn't work, see
