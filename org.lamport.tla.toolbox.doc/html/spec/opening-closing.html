<h1>Manipulating Specs</h1>
<p>
A specification has a <em>name</em> and a <em>root module</em>, which
is in a file whose extension is <code>.tla</code>.&nbsp;  You will probably
give your spec the same name as its root module, but you need not.&nbsp;
You can create two different specifications with the same root module, but there's
little reason to do that.&nbsp;  Two different specs cannot have the same name.&nbsp;
Here are the Toolbox's spec operations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning:</b> if you want to use the <a href="../model/model.html">model checker</a>,
your spec must not contain a module named&nbsp; <code>MC</code>&nbsp;.
</p>
<h3>Create</h3>

You can create a new spec with the&nbsp;
<samp>File/Open Spec/Add New Spec...&nbsp;</samp> menu item.&nbsp;  
It raises a dialog asking you to choose the root file (which must have
the extension <code>.tla</code>) and the 
specification name.  


<h3>Open</h3>

You can open an existing spec by choosing it from the&nbsp;
<samp>File/Open Spec</samp> menu.&nbsp;  You can also use the 
<em>Spec Explorer</em>, which is opened by clicking on the
<IMG SRC=spec-explorer-icon.gif Align=bottom> icon on the left side of the Toolbox, near the top.&nbsp;
Right-click on the desired spec and select <samp>Open</samp>.&nbsp;  If you open a spec when another spec
is open, the other spec will automatically be closed.


<h3>Close</h3>

You can close a spec with the&nbsp; <samp>File/Close Spec</samp>&nbsp; menu.&nbsp;  
This returns you to the Welcome View.&nbsp;
However, remember that the toolbox will close the current spec if you open another one.

<h3>Delete and Rename</h3>

You can delete or rename an existing spec by opening the Spec Explorer (described above), 
right-clicking on
the desired spec, and making the appropriate choice.&nbsp;  
Deleting a spec does not delete any of the specification's
files.&nbsp;  
However, it will delete all its <a href = "../model/about-models.html">TLC models</a>.

<h3>Finding Your Spec</h3>

It's easy to forget where in your file system a spec's module files are.&nbsp;  
To find them, open the
Spec Explorer view, right-click
on the spec's name, and select&nbsp;<samp>Properties</samp>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  
This will bring
up a dialog that shows you the root-module file's complete path name.&nbsp;  
(The rest of the spec's module files are in the same folder.)

<h3>Moving a Spec from Elsewhere</h3>

<P> Here is how to move an existing spec named&nbsp; <samp>SName&nbsp;</samp> to a 
different folder (directory) on the
same computer, or to a different computer.&nbsp;  Copy all the spec's module files
(the root-module file and its imported module files)
and the folder (directory) named&nbsp; <samp>SName.toolbox&nbsp;</samp> to the new
location.&nbsp;  If there is already a spec named&nbsp; <samp>SName&nbsp;</samp> (which
will be the case if you're moving the spec to a different place on the same computer),
delete it from the Toolbox.&nbsp;  Open a new specification named &nbsp; <samp>SName&nbsp;</samp>
using the new copy of the root-module file.
 </P>

<h3>Keeping Copies of a Spec on Different Computers</h3> 

 <p> 
You may want to run the Toolbox on different machines for the same
spec.&nbsp;

Once you've created a spec on one machine, copy the spec's module
files and <samp>.toolbox&nbsp;</samp> directory to the other machine
and use the instructions above to create a copy of the spec on that
machine.&nbsp;

When you modify the spec or its models on one machine, just copy the
module files and <samp>.toolbox&nbsp;</samp> directory to the other
machine.&nbsp;

Strange things might happen if you do that while the spec is open in
the Toolbox on that other machine.&nbsp;

It's a good idea to close spec on that machine before copying the
files.&nbsp;  If you forget to do that, you will probably need to
close and re-open the spec to see the new version in the Toolbox.&nbsp;  
If strange things happen when you do that, try closing and re-opening
the Toolbox.
