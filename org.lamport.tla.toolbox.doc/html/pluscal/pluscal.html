<h1>The PlusCal Translator</h1>

 <P> 
PlusCal is an algorithm language based on TLA+.&nbsp;  A PlusCal algorithm is written as a comment
in a TLA+ module.&nbsp;  The PlusCal translator writes the TLA+ translation of the algorithm into
the module.&nbsp;  See the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/pluscal.html" target="_blank"> PlusCal
web page</a> for more information about PlusCal, including a language manual.&nbsp;  An overview of the
language is provided by the paper 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#pluscal" target="_blank">The 
PlusCal Algorithm Language</a>.  
 </P>
 
 <p>Toolbox support for the PlusCal translator is still fairly primitive.&nbsp;
 You run the translator on the module in the currently selected
 module editor by clicking 
  on&nbsp; <samp>File/Translate PlusCal Algorithm</samp>.&nbsp;
 Translation errors are displayed in  
    the same&nbsp; <samp>Parsing Error</samp>&nbsp; view where <a href="../spec/parsing.html">TLA+ parsing
    errors</a> are displayed.&nbsp;  Some errors in a PlusCal algorithm are not found by the translator, but
    instead produce parsing errors in the TLA+ module.&nbsp;  Those are displayed as ordinary TLA+ parsing errors.
 </p>
 
 <p>Currently, the only way to control the translator options is to state explicitly
 the options with which the translator is called.&nbsp;  This is done by opening the&nbsp;
 <samp>Spec Explorer</samp>&nbsp; view (see the <a href="../spec/opening-closing.html">Manipulating Specs help page</a>), right-clicking on the spec,
 choosing&nbsp; <samp>Properties</samp>, and entering the desired options in
 the&nbsp; <samp>PlusCal call arguments</samp>&nbsp; field.&nbsp;  For example, to specify
 weak fairness, you would enter&nbsp; <code>-wf</code>&nbsp;.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The Toolbox now provides only one PlusCal translator preference.&nbsp;  You can have the translator
 automatically called when you modify and then save a module containing a PlusCal algorithm.&nbsp;
 (More precisely, it is called if the module contains the text &nbsp; <code>--algorithm</code>&nbsp;
 anywhere within it.)&nbsp;  You can set it by selecting
 the&nbsp; <samp>PlusCal Translator Preferences</samp>&nbsp; page 
 from among the 
 TLA+ Preferences.&nbsp; (See the <a href="../gettingstarted/preferences.html">Preferences help page</a>.)
 The default is not to translate on save.
