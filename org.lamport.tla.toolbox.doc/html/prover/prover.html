<h1>Proofs</h1>

<p>
The current version of the TLA+ language, called TLA+2, contains
several features not described in 
   <em><a href=
    "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" 
     target="_blank">
   Specifying Systems</a></em>.&nbsp;  

Chief among them are constructs for writing hierarchically structured
proofs.&nbsp;

TLA+2 and TLA+2 proofs are described
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla2.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;  

TLAPS, the <A href="http://msr-inria.inria.fr/~doligez/tlaps/" 
     target="_blank">TLA+ Proof System</A>,
is a tool for mechanically checking TLA+ proofs.&nbsp;  

Soon, you will be able to run TLAPS from the Toolbox.&nbsp;

You will be able to select the parts of a proof to be checked, and the
Toolbox will display which steps' proofs have and have not been
checked.&nbsp;

The module editor will also provide useful commands for writing
proofs.&nbsp;

Currently, the only sign of these features is a useless <samp>TLA
Proof Manager</samp> menu.&nbsp;


The one feature the Toolbox now provides for readers and writers of
proofs is a nice way of <A href="reading.html">viewing structured TLA+
proofs</A>.
