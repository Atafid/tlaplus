<h1>Proofs</h1>

<p>
The current version of the TLA+ language contains
several features not described in 
   <em><a href=
    "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" 
     target="_blank">
   Specifying Systems</a></em>.&nbsp;  

Chief among them are constructs for writing hierarchically structured
proofs.&nbsp;

The differences between the current and previous versions of TLA, including
the  proof language, are described
  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla2.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;  
</p>

<p>
A TLA+ proof is heirarchically structured.&nbsp;

The Toolbox aids reading and writing proofs
by providing commands to view just the part of the structure that you
want to see.&nbsp;

These commands are described in the subtopic
<A href="reading.html">Viewing Structured
Proofs</A>.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="runningTlaps.html">Running TLAPS</a> subtopic
describes how to run
TLAPS, the <A href="http://msr-inria.inria.fr/~doligez/tlaps/" 
     target="_blank">TLA+ Proof System</A>, which 
is a tool for mechanically checking TLA+ proofs.&nbsp;  


You can select the parts of a proof to be checked, and you can have the
Toolbox  display which steps' proofs have and have not been
checked.&nbsp;
