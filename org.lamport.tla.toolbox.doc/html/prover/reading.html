<h1>Viewing Structured Proofs</h1>

<p> When you open in the module editor a module containing a theorem
wth a proof, you will see a &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp; next to the
theorem and next to each step that has a subproof.&nbsp; To avoid
repeatedly saying <em>step or theorem</em>, we here take a
<em>step</em> to be either a theorem or a step of a theorem's
proof.&nbsp;

Clicking on the &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp; next to a step hides the
step's proof and changes the &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp; to a
&nbsp;<samp>(+)</samp>&nbsp;.

Clicking on the &nbsp;<samp>(+)</samp>&nbsp; undoes the effect of
clicking on the &nbsp;<samp>(-)</samp>&nbsp;.


Right-clicking on a step provides the following menu options for
hiding and revealing parts of the proof of the step at which the
cursor is positioned.&nbsp;  (The indicated pair of keystrokes can be used
instead.)

<dl>

<dt> <b>Show Current Subtree</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+S</samp> </dt>
<dd> Reveals the proof of the step.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Hide Current Subtree</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+H</samp> </dt>
<dd> Hides the proof of the step.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Show Children Only</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+C</samp> </dt>
<dd> Reveals the top level of the step's proof.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Focus on Step</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+F</samp> </dt>
<dd> Hides everything except the top level of the step's proof and
the siblings (steps at the same level as) of the step and
of every ancestor of that step in the proof.</dd>
</dl>

The following commands can be performed by right-clicking anywhere
in the module.

<dl>
<dt> <b>Show All Proofs</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+A</samp> </dt>
<dd> Reveals the complete proof of every theorem in the module.</dd>
<p> </p>

<dt> <b>Hide All Proofs</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; <samp>Ctl+G Ctl+N</samp> </dt>
<dd> Hides the proof of every theorem in the module.</dd>
</dl>
The <em>Focus on Step</em> command performed outside a proof
is equivalent to <em>Hide All Proofs</em>
