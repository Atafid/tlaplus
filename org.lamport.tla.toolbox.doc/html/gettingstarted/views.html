<h1>Managing Views</h1>

<p> 
Your Toolbox window contains a collection of subwindows called <dfn>views</dfn>.
A view is identified by a tab in the upper left-hand corner.  The tab for
the welcome view that you saw when you started the toobox for the first time
looks like this: 
<pre>
     <IMG SRC=view-tab.gif Align=bottom> 
</pre>
You can delete a view by clicking on the <samp>X</samp>.  This just removes
the view; it does not affect whatever the view is viewing.  For example,
deleting a view that shows a  file does not delete the file.

 <p>
Views are grouped in folders.
Here is a typical state of the Toolbox.
</p>
<pre>
     <IMG SRC=folders.gif Align=bottom> 
</pre>
<p>
It has two folders.  One contains two module-editor views for the module files 
<samp>ClientModule.tla</samp> and <samp>FileModule.tla</samp>.  These
views allow you to edit those files.
 The <samp>*</samp> preceding the name
<samp>FileModule.tla</samp> indicates that the file has unsaved
modifications.  The other folder contains a Help view. 
</p>

 <p>
The buttons <IMG SRC=folder-minimize.gif Align=bottom> at the top right-hand side
of the folder allow you to minimize 
the folder or maximize the currently selected view, minimizing all other
folders.  Clicking on the <IMG SRC=unmaximize.gif Align=bottom> button that 
replaces the maximize button undoes the maximization.  The 
 </p>
<pre>  
      <IMG SRC=minimized-folder.gif >
</pre>
<p>
 at the right edge of the Toolbox window is a minimized folder that can 
be restored by left-clicking on its tab, holding down the mouse button, and
dragging the view to where you want it.  This creates a new folder containing
the view.  You can drag the view into an existing folder, except that
a folder containing an editor view can contain only other module-editor
views.  (Hence, you can't drag a module-editor view into a folder containing
a help view.)   
</p>

<p>
Folders not containing an editor view can also occur outside the Toolbox 
window in their own separate windows.  You can create such a folder by
simply dragging a non-editor view outside the Toolbox window.
