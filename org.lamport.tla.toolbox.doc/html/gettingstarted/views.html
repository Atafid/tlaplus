<h1>Managing Views</h1>

<p> 
Your Toolbox window contains a collection of subwindows called <dfn>views</dfn>.&nbsp;
A view is identified by a tab in the upper left-hand corner.&nbsp;  The tab for
the welcome view that you saw when you started the toobox for the first time
looks like this: 
<pre>
     <IMG SRC=view-tab.gif Align=bottom> 
</pre>
You can delete a view by clicking on the <samp>X</samp>.&nbsp;  This just removes
the view; it does not affect whatever the view is viewing.&nbsp;  For example,
deleting a view that shows a  file does not delete the file.

 <p>
Views are grouped in folders.&nbsp;
Here is a typical state of the Toolbox.
</p>
<pre>
     <IMG SRC=folders.gif Align=bottom> 
</pre>
<p>
It has two folders.&nbsp;  One contains two module-editor views for the module files 
<samp>ClientModule.tla</samp> and <samp>FileModule.tla</samp>.&nbsp;  These
views allow you to edit those files.&nbsp;
 The <samp>*</samp> preceding the name
<samp>FileModule.tla</samp> indicates that the file has unsaved
modifications.&nbsp;  The other folder contains a Help view. 
</p>

 <p>
The buttons <IMG SRC=folder-minimize.gif Align=bottom> at the top right-hand side
of the folder allow you to minimize 
the folder or maximize the currently selected view, minimizing all other
folders.&nbsp;  Clicking on the <IMG SRC=unmaximize.gif Align=bottom> button that 
replaces the maximize button undoes the maximization.&nbsp;  The 
 </p>
<pre>  
      <IMG SRC=minimized-folder.gif >
</pre>
<p>
 at the right edge of the Toolbox window is a minimized folder that can 
be restored by left-clicking on its tab.
</p>
<p>
You can move a view by clicking on its tab, holding down the mouse button, and
dragging the view to where you want it.&nbsp;  This creates a new folder containing
the view.&nbsp;  You can drag the view into an existing folder, except that
a folder containing an editor view can contain only other module-editor
views.&nbsp;  Hence, you can't drag a module-editor view into a folder containing
a help view.&nbsp;   You can create subfolders of the folder containing a module-editor
view by dragging module-editor views around within the folder.&nbsp;  You can also
create multiple views on the same module by right-clicking on the tab
and choosing <em>New Editor</em>.
</p>

<p>
Folders not containing an editor view can also occur outside the Toolbox 
window in their own separate windows.&nbsp;  You can create such a folder by
simply dragging a non-editor view outside the Toolbox window.
