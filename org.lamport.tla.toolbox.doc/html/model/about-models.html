<h1>Models</h1>

 <p> 
You run the TLC model checker on a <em>model</em> of your spec.&nbsp;  The model
tells TLC what it should do.&nbsp;  Here are the parts of the model
that you must explicitly choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the <a href="../spec/what-is.html">behavior spec</a> is.</li>

<li>What TLC should check.</li>

<li>What values to substitute for constant parameters.</li>
</ul>
 <p>
 The <em><a href="overview-page.html">Model Overview Page</a></em> 
 and <em><a href="advanced-page.html">Advanced Page</a></em> 
 help pages describe all the things that can go into a model.
 </p>

<p>
A specification may contain multiple models.&nbsp;  You can create a new model or open an existing one
by clicking on the&nbsp; <samp>TLC Model Checker</samp>&nbsp; menu.&nbsp;  Alternatively, you can use
the <a href="../spec/opening-closing.html">Spec Explorer</a>.&nbsp;  To create a new model, 
open the <a href="../spec/opening-closing.html">Spec Explorer</a> and right-click on
the currently open spec.&nbsp;  To open an existing model, open the spec's menu item (by clicking on the&nbsp; <samp>+</samp>&nbsp;)
and double-clicking on the model.&nbsp;  Right-clicking on the model also gives you the options of
renaming it, deleting it, and creating a clone--a copy with a different name.
</p>

<p>
When you model check a spec, you should begin with a very small model--that is, a model for which the 
values substituted for constants (and perhaps a <a href="model/advanced-page.html#state">constraint</a>)
yield a small set of reachable states.&nbsp;  Before you've model checked it, your spec almost surely contains
quite a few errors.&nbsp;  Using a small model, TLC can find the trivial ones very quickly.&nbsp;  When it finds
no errors in a small model, you can then gradually increase the size of the model.
</p>

<p>
As you run your spec on larger and larger models, it's easy to forget what you've done.&nbsp;  Instead of
changing a model and running it again, create a new model and keep the old one.&nbsp;  
(This is easy to do by cloning the model, as described above.)
It will be easier to identify
your models if you put the important contents of the model in the model name--for example, you can name a model
</p>
<pre>
   N=3,Proc={a1,a2,a3}
</pre>
<p>
The Toolbox keeps a
copy of the version of the spec on which the model was run, so you can look at it even after you 
have changed the spec.&nbsp;
(You cannot yet examine that version with the Toolbox.  See the 
<a href="executing-tlc.html#MC">How TLC is Run</a>
help-page section to find out where
those saved files are.)
