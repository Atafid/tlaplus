<h1>Model Overview Page</h1>

 <P> 
This model editor page is usually the only one you will use to create
and run your model.&nbsp;  Here are what the different sections of the
page are for. 
 </P>


<h2>What is the behavior spec?</h2>

The behavior spec is the formula or pair of formulas that describe the
possible behaviors of the system or algorithm you want to check.&nbsp;  (See
the <a href="../spec/what-is.html"><em>What Is A Spec?</em></a> help page.)&nbsp;
There are two ways to write the behavior spec:
<dl>
<dt><b>Init and Next</b></dt>
<dd>A pair of formulas that specify the initial state and the next-state relation,
respectively.
</dd>
<br></br>
<dt><b>Single formula</b></dt>
<dd>A single temporal formula of the form&nbsp; <code>Init /\ [][Next]<sub>vars</sub> /\ F</code>,&nbsp;
where&nbsp; <code>Init</code>&nbsp; is the initial predicate,&nbsp; 
  <code>Next</sub></code>&nbsp; is the next-state 
relation,&nbsp; <code>vars</code>&nbsp;
is the tuple of variables,
and&nbsp; <code>F</code>&nbsp; is the fairness formula.

</dd>
</dl>
The only way to write a behavior spec that includes fairness is with a temporal formula.
<p>
If the spec has no variables, then there can be no behavior formula.&nbsp;  In that case, all TLC
can check are assumptions.

<h2>What to check?</h2>
There are three kinds of properties of the behavior spec that TLC can check:
<h3>Deadlock</h3>

A <em>deadlock</em> is said to occur in a state for which the next-state relation
allows no successor states.&nbsp;  Termination is deadlock that is not considered an error.&nbsp;
If you want the behavior spec to allow termination, then you should uncheck the
deadlock option.

<h3>Invariants</h3>

An invariant is a state predicate that is true of all reachable states--that is, 
states that can occur in a behavior allowed by the behavior spec.&nbsp;  You can include
a list of invariants.&nbsp;  The checking of each invariant can be enabled or disabled
by checking or unchecking its box.


<h3>Properties</h3>

TLC can check if the behavior spec satisfies (implies) a temporal property, which
is expressed as a temporal-logic formula.&nbsp;  You can specify a list of such properties,
each with a check-box for enabling or disabling its checking.

<h2><a name="what-is-model">What is the model?</a></h2>

The most basic part of a model is an assignment of values to declared constants.&nbsp;
To assign a value to a constant, either double-click on it or select it and click on the&nbsp; 
<samp>Edit</samp>&nbsp; button.&nbsp;  This will raise a pop-up dialog giving you the choice
of three ways to assign a value to it:  
<dl>
<dt><b>Ordinary assignment</b></dt>
<dd>You can set the value of the constant to any constant TLA+ expression that
contains only symbols defined in the spec.&nbsp;  The expression can even include
declared constants, as long as the value assigned to a constant does not depend
on that constant.&nbsp;  (If there are circular dependencies, TLC will
produce a&nbsp; <samp>Java StackOverflowError</samp>&nbsp; error.
</dd>
<br></br>
<dt><b>Model value</b></dt>
<dd>It assigns to the constant a model value of the same name.&nbsp;  (See
the <a href="model-values.html"><em>Model Value and Symmetry</em></a> 
help page.)
</dd>
<br></br>
<dt><b>Set of model values</b></dt>
<dd>You must enter comma-separated list of legal model-value names,
optionally enclosed by&nbsp; <code>{</code>&nbsp;
and&nbsp; <code>}</code>.&nbsp;  You will have the option of making them
a symmetry set.  
<p>
A <em>typed</em> model value is one whose name begins with a letter
and an underscore--for example,&nbsp; <code>p_42a</code>.&nbsp;  If you
enter a set of model values that are not all of the same type,
you will have to click&nbsp; <samp>Next</samp>&nbsp;
to continue.&nbsp;  You will then be given the choice of specifying a type
for the set you have just entered.&nbsp;  For example, if you entered the
set&nbsp; <code>{2, a, b}</code>&nbsp; and choose the 
type&nbsp; <code>t</code>&nbsp;, the constant will be assigned the
set&nbsp; <code>{t_2, t_a, t_b}</code>&nbsp; of model values.&nbsp;
Note that a number like&nbsp; <code>2</code>&nbsp; is not a 
legal model value.
<p> See the <a href="model-values.html"><em>Model Values and Symmetry</em></a> 
help page to learn about typed values and symmetry sets.

</dd>

<h2>How to run?</h2>

Here, you specify the following two aspects of how TLC should
be run.&nbsp;  (See the <a href="advanced-page.html#launching">TLC Options</a> section
of the <a href="advanced-page.html"><em>Advanced Options Page</em></a> help page.)

<h3>TLC Parameters</h3>
There are two parameters that you can set here:

<h4>Maximum JVM heap size in MB:</h4>

This defines how large a heap TLC will use.&nbsp;  If you make it too small, TLC
could run out of heap space.&nbsp;  If you make it too large, your machine will not have
enough memory and TLC will not start.&nbsp;  
TLC keeps its set of reachable states
on disk, so the number of reachable states does not affect how much heap space
TLC uses.&nbsp;  It can run out of heap space only if it takes too much memory to represent the
set of initial states or the set of successor states of a single state.&nbsp;  So this number 
rarely needs to be larger than a few hundred MB.&nbsp;  If TLC does run out of stack space,
you can give it more and restart it from a checkpoint.

<h4>Number of worker threads</h4>

TLC's algorithm for computing the set (actually the graph) of reachable states 
is highly parallelizable, and it can make good use of arbitrarily many processors.&nbsp; 
This parameter specifies the number of separate threads that TLC will spawn to
perform that computation.&nbsp;  You should not set it to be greater than the number of
separate processors (cores) on your computer; the Toolbox will warn you if you do.

<h3>Checkpoint Recovery</h3>

TLC takes regular checkpoints, from which it can be restarted if it is stopped
for any reason--for example, if your computer crashes.&nbsp;  The 
<em>Recover from checkpoint</em> option tells TLC to start from where the
state recorded by the checkpoint when you run it.&nbsp;
This option is enabled 
if the last time you ran TLC, it ran long enough to produce a checkpoint.&nbsp; 
The Toolbox will fill in the <em>Checkpoint id</em> for you.

<p>
Warning: If you exit the Toolbox, it will stop any executions of TLC that are in
process.&nbsp;  However, it is possible to stop the Toolbox in some drastic fashion that
leaves TLC running as a background process.&nbsp;  Restarting from a checkpoint while
the TLC process that created it is still running can cause the checkpoint to be destroyed, 
making recovery impossible.&nbsp;  If you have reason to believe TLC was not stopped,
check to see if it is still running before trying to recover from a checkpoint.
