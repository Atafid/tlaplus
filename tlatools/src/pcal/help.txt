This is the +cal translator, which translates a +cal algorithm into
a TLA+ specification.  The translator is called by typing

   java pcal.trans [options] input-file

where input-file is a TLA+ file (the extension .tla need not be typed)
containing the algorithm.  See the +cal manual for an explanation of
what the TLA+ file must contain.  The possible options are

  -help  : Types this file instead of running the translator.

  -wf : Conjoin to formula Spec weak fairness of each process's
        next-state action

  -sf : Conjoin to formula Spec strong fairness of each process's
        next-state action

  -wfNext : Conjoin to formula Spec weak fairness of the entire
            next-state action

  -nof : Conjoin no fairness formula to Spec.  This is the default,
         except when the -termination option is chosen.

  -termination : Add to the .cfg file the command
                    PROPERTY Termination
                 With this option, the default fairness option
                 becomes -wf.

  -nocfg : Suppress writing of the .cfg file.

  -label : Tells the translator to add missing labels.  This is
           the default only for a uniprocess algorithm in which
           the user has typed no labels.

  -reportLabels : True if the translator should print the names
                  and locations of all labels it adds.  Like
                  -label, it tells the translator to add missing
                  labels.

  -labelRoot name : If the translator adds missing labels, it
                    names them name1, name2, etc.  The default value
                    is "Lbl_".


  -unixEOL : Forces the use of Unix end-of-line convention, regardless
             of the system's default.  Without this, when run on
             Windows, the files it writes seem to have a "^M" at the
             end of every line when viewed with Emacs.

  -spec name : Uses TLC and the TLA+ specification name.tla to do
               the translation.  It copies the files name.tla and
               name.cfg from the directory containing the translator's
               Java source files to the current directory; it writes in
               the current director the file AST.tla that defines
               `fairness' to equal the fairness option and `ast' to
               equal the the AST data structure representing the
               algorithm; and it runs TLC on name.tla to produce the
               translation.

  -myspec name : Like -spec, except it finds the files names.tla
                 and names.cfg in the current directory, instead
                 of writing them there.

  -spec2   name
  -myspec2 name : Like -spec and -myspec, except they use TLC2
                  instead of TLC (aka TLC1).

  -writeAST : Writes the AST file as in the -spec option, but does
              not perform the translation.

  -debug : This is useful only for maintainers of the program
           and has no effect on normal execution.
